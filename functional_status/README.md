# AgingNLP - MCI - Functional status extraction and prediction 

Patients' functional status assesses their independence in performing activities of daily living (ADL), encompassing basic ADLs (bADL) such as bathing, dressing, and transferring, and more complex instrumental activities (iADL) like managing finances and meal preparation. Because functional status information is largely based on surveys and questionnaire instruments and stored in EHR in semi-structured or free text format, there is a strong need to leverage computational approaches such as natural language processing (NLP) to facilitate and accelerate the manual extraction and curation effort of functional status information. We developed a hybrid federated NLP framework to extract functional status information from EHRs across multiple healthcare institutions.


## Definition of Functional Status:
International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF)

## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

Java 1.8

#### NLP Backbone Infrastructure based on MedTaggerIE
MedTagger contains a suite of programs that the Mayo Clinic NLP program has developed in 2013. It includes three major components: MedTagger for indexing based on dictionaries, MedTaggerIE for information extraction based on patterns, and MedTaggerML for machine learning-based named entity recognition.
